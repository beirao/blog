Hi, I'm Beirao.

I'm a Security Researcher at [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), focusing on EVM and SVM smart contract audits. I've audited leading protocols such as EigenLayer, Euler, Morpho, Compound and more.

I've conducted 14+ private security reviews, participated in security contests, and bug bounties. My expertise includes fuzzing, invariant testing, and formal verification.

Currently building [Zeus Audit](http://www.zeus-audit.com/), a AI auditing SaaS.

Committed to making Web3 a safer place every day.
