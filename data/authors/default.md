Hi, I'm Beirao.

I am a former independent security researcher, where I specialized in [private audits](/tags/reports), [security contests](https://code4rena.com/@0xBeirao), and bug bounties. Now, I lead security initiatives as Head of Security at [Conclave](https://conclave.io/).

At Conclave, I oversee the development of the innovative **Cod3x DeFi stack**, ensuring our platform meets the industry's highest security standards.

My key development contributions include:

- [**Reliquary V2**](https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Reliquary)
- [**Cod3x Lend**](https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend)
- [**Cod3x USD**](https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-USD)

Every day, I'm committed to learning and innovating to make WEB3 a safer place.
