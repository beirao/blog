Hey there, I'm Beirao!

I'm just a guy diving headfirst into the smart contract security and WEB3.

I've got an engineering degree under my belt, and I'm currently working as an independent security researcher.

I started learning full development with Patrick Collins in mid-2022, and went deeper into security research early 2023.

I'm constantly learning to make WEB3 a safer place! My mission is to audit and secure smart contracts, keeping them safe from hacks.

I've already cracked the Top 150 on [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard) and won some rewards on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com).

As a result, companies have approached me to audit their smart contracts.

If you're one of them and need a thorough code review or top-notch smart contract development, shoot me a [DM](https://twitter.com/0xBeirao)!
