Hello friends :3

Welcome to my personal website. Here I share some of my thoughts and achievements about my WEB3 journey. I've just finished my engineering degree and now I'm working in a company as a smart contracts engineer.

I started learning full-stack WEB3 development in mid-2022 with the [FCC Patrick course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) and started my security journey in January with the famous cmichel blog post [How to become a smart contract auditor](https://cmichel.io/how-to-become-a-smart-contract-auditor/).

I've achieved some great results. I made it to the top 150 on [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard) and even won some rewards on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com).

In addition to my primary role, I extend my skills as a contractor specializing in EVM smart contracts security and development. If you're in need of robust code review or high quality smart contracts development for your startup, I'm here to assist. Don't hesitate to get in touch via Twitter or Email.
