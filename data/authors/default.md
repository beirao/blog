Hi, I'm Beirao.

I'm a Senior Security Researcher at [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), focusing on EVM and SVM smart contract audits. I've audited leading protocols such as EigenLayer, Euler, Morpho, and Compound.

I'm also CSO at [Astera](https://astera.fi/), where I oversee security and develop innovative DeFi protocols:

- **Astera Lending** – A credit market combining the best of Morpho and AAVE
- **Astera USD** – A governance-free, fully automated stablecoin with advanced DeFi integrations
- **Balancer V3 TWAP Oracle** – Built on Balancer V3 hooks

I've conducted 11+ private security reviews, participated in security contests, and bug bounties. My expertise includes fuzzing, invariant testing, and formal verification.

Committed to making Web3 a safer place every day.
