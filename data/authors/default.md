Hello friends :3

Welcome to my personal website. Here I share all my thoughts and achievements about my WEB3 journey. I've just finished my engineering degree and now I'm working in a company as a smart contracts engineer.

I started learning full-stack WEB3 development in mid-2022 with the [FCC Patrick course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) and started my security journey in January with the famous cmichel blog post [How to become a smart contract auditor](https://cmichel.io/how-to-become-a-smart-contract-auditor/).

In just 2 months, I managed to win 13000€ in public contests on [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard) and 10000€ on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com).

Even though I love auditing, I have a lot of entrepreneurial ambitions and I'm excited about creating my own DeFi protocol one day. Big things are coming, so don't forget to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xBeirao).
