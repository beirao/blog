# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **Options Token Compounder** protocol was done by [Beirao](https://www.beirao.xyz/about), with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About **Options Token Compounder**

The `OptionsCompounder` contract is an abstract token that should be implemented into a complete strategy. The `OptionsCompounder` helps to compound oTokens by exercising them at a discounted price and then exchanging the payment token for the vault asset (`want`). The `want` token can then be used in a strategy.

## Flow of Options Token Compounder used in a strategy (from the documentation)

The strategy must properly implement the virtual functions of the Options Token Compounder it inherits from

1. Admin configures swap paths, oracles, initializer args, etc
2. Strategy has an oToken balance
3. Keeper calls harvestOTokens
4. getPaymentAmount from discountExercise given oToken balance
5. Flash loan the necessary amount of funds to exercise in paymentToken
6. Flashloan callback -> executeOperation -> exerciseOptionAndReturnDebt
7. oTokens are exercised using paymentToken that was flash loaned
8. Underlying token is received by the strategy, swap entire amount into payment token to repay flashloan
   1. Calculate minAmountOut by directly querying the same oracle consumed by the DiscountExercise we interact with
9. Assess profitability in units of paymentToken, swap profits to want of the strategy if not same token as paymentToken
   1. Calculate minAmountOut by directly querying the same oracle used by the DiscountExercise we interact with
10. Assess profitability in units of wantToken
11. Emit event reflecting the oTokens compounded

## Observations

If we forget about admin/config functions. The operational flow consists of

- `harvestOTokens()` (limited to the KEEPER role)

This `OptionsCompounder` takes place in a larger ecosystem of contracts, that are composed by:

- the `reaperVaultV2`, which acts like an ERC4626 vault
- and all the strategies implemented in that vault to generate returns.

The `OptionsCompounder` seems to fit nicely into this system. It doesn't interfere with the overall system.

## Privileged Roles & Actors

The `OptionsCompounder` borrows the `ReaperBaseStrategyv4` access control which consists of 4 roles but only 2 are used in this contract:

1. ADMIN - can configure the contract
2. KEEPER - can call `harvestOTokens()`.

# Severity classification

| Severity           | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| Likelihood: High   | High         | High           | Medium      |
| Likelihood: Medium | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| Likelihood: Low    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

**Impact** - the technical, economic and reputation damage of a successful attack

**Likelihood** - the chance that a particular vulnerability gets discovered and exploited

**Severity** - the overall criticality of the risk

# Detailed Findings

# [H-01] Loss of fund when the `Exercise` contract is not funded

## Description

The Option Token contract has been modified to delay payment if the `Exercise` contract is not sufficiently funded, but this strategy has not been modified to deal with this new mechanism.

If the `Exercise` contract is not sufficiently funded, the `underlyingToken` is not sent ([DiscountExercise.sol#L177](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-token/blob/9aa8a91e6788ada2354682e43e781e1c691af574/src/exercise/DiscountExercise.sol#L177)) and the `[claim()](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-token/blob/9aa8a91e6788ada2354682e43e781e1c691af574/src/exercise/DiscountExercise.sol#L105-L110)` function must be called later.

Since `OptionsCompounder` never calls this claim function, any delayed funds will be lost.

## Recommendations

I recommend to revert if the `Exercise` contract is not enough funded.

Add this line before calling `optionToken.exercise()` ([OptionsCompounder.sol#L318](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-compounder/blob/c91558740495530b43140179b18701d23dc304f9/src/OptionsCompounder.sol#L318))

```solidity
require(underlyingToken.balanceOf(exerciserContract) >= optionsAmount);
```

You can also choose to deal with this delayed payment mechanism, but this will require more modifications.

# [L-01] `lendingPool` and `addressProvider` can't be changed

## Description

This can be critical if the `lendingPool` is paused or hacked, the flashloan will be inaccessible causing a DOS of the compounding feature.

## Recommendations

You can do a full upgrade to fix this, but I recommend adding a setter.

# [L-02] Initial balance of `PaymentToken` will never be swapped

[OptionsCompounder.sol#L352](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-compounder/blob/c91558740495530b43140179b18701d23dc304f9/src/OptionsCompounder.sol#L352)

## Description

To calculate the amount of `paymentToken` to swap, we subtract the `initialBalance`:

```solidity
gainInPaymentToken = (assetBalance - initialBalance) - totalAmountToPay;

```

This should not happen, but if there are `paymentTokens` left in the contract, they will not be swapped.

## POC

- KEEPER calls `harvestOTokens()` but forgets to pass a `minWantAmount` (so `minWantAmount` == 0).
- The swap fails ([OptionsCompounder.sol#L366](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-compounder/blob/c91558740495530b43140179b18701d23dc304f9/src/OptionsCompounder.sol#L366)) but since the swapper (swap is in a try/catch) doesn't revert the transaction continues.
- This last slippage check pass since `gainInWantToken == minWantAmount` [OptionsCompounder.sol#L378](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-compounder/blob/c91558740495530b43140179b18701d23dc304f9/src/OptionsCompounder.sol#L378)
- Now `paymentToken` are left in the contract and can be swapped (without admin intervention)

## Recommendations

- Do a 0 check on `minWantAmount`.
- You can also remove the initialBalance subtraction [OptionsCompounder.sol#L352](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-compounder/blob/c91558740495530b43140179b18701d23dc304f9/src/OptionsCompounder.sol#L352)

```solidity
gainInPaymentToken = assetBalance - totalAmountToPay;
```

# [I-01] The strategy can only deal with one exercise contract

`oToken` can work with multiple `Exercise` contracts, but `OptionsCompounder` can only work with one.

If you think that multiple exercise contracts can be a use case, you can add this support.

# [I-02] `modes[]` wrong array size

[OptionsCompounder.sol#L212](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-compounder/blob/c91558740495530b43140179b18701d23dc304f9/src/OptionsCompounder.sol#L212) should be 1 not 2.
