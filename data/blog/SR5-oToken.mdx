# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the an options Token protocol was done by [Beirao](https://www.beirao.xyz/about), with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About Options Token

An option token represents the right to purchase the underlying token at a price set by Oracle.

## Observations

The system looks secure by design:

- by limiting concurrent interactions: there is only 1 possible external call for users (`exercise()`)
- by limiting the number of tokens left in the system.
- The system doesn't rely on `balanceOf()`.

The main vulnerability is common to all TWAP implementations (Uniswap, Balancer and Thena). During the review I focused mainly on this area. Using these types of oracle is not ideal for [several reasons] (https://chainsecurity.com/oracle-manipulation-after-merge/), but we are forced to deal with it since there are no other solutions to get the price on small capitalization tokens. The team implemented a `minPrice` guard. In case of price manipulation, this guard will limit the impact.

The admin has some power and many admin functions are error-prone. I would recommend improving input validation [L-03] for all admin functions to reduce the risk of errors.

This system is deployed under a UUPS proxy using Open Zeppelin. The UUPS implementation looks fine. The team is using best practices by using the "upgrade" hardhat plugin which does security checks in the background. I recommend doing a mock upgrade + running tests on this upgrade (using the same plugin) just to be 100% sure the proxy is working perfectly.

# Detailed Findings

# [M-01] `exercise()` possible DOS

[DiscountExercise.sol#L141](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-token/blob/4ebc890c26b3fd6a4fae5bbdf20d4e690d2533db/src/exercise/DiscountExercise.sol#L141)

## Description

The documentation says: "We limit the amount of funds we leave in an exercise contract at any given time to limit risk. But if the contract is not funded, calling `exercise()` will revert, causing the user to not get their token when they expected. Since a user may want to time his exercise price, not being able to claim his due is not fair.

## Recommendations

If the contract is underfunded, I suggest storing the unclaimed `underlyingToken` in a variable to allow the user to claim his tokens later.

This can be done by

- checking if the underlying contract token balance is sufficient
- then storing the unclaimed tokens in a mapping
- and allowing the user to claim their token afterwards by adding a `claim()` function.

# [M-02] `distributeFeesFrom()` and `distributeFees()` don’t distribute fees correctly

[BaseExercise.sol#L66-L86](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-token/blob/4ebc890c26b3fd6a4fae5bbdf20d4e690d2533db/src/exercise/BaseExercise.sol#L66-L86)

## Description

The `BaseExercise` does not distribute fees correctly. In the `distributeFeesFrom()` and `distributeFees()` function the `totalAmount` is updated at each loop, making the next fee inaccurate.

Let’s say we want to distribute 1000 USDC to 4 recipients equally (25% each one).

- 1st recipient will receive 1000 \* 25 / 100 = **250 USDC**
- 2nd recipient will receive 750 \* 25 / 100 = **187,5 USDC**
- 3rd recipient will receive 562,5 \* 25 / 100 = **140,6 USDC**
- 4th recipient will receive **422 USDC**

Everyone should have received **250 USDC** but \*\*\*\*that’s not the case here.

```jsx
function distributeFeesFrom(uint256 totalAmount, IERC20 token, address from) internal virtual {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < feeRecipients.length - 1; i++) {
        uint256 feeAmount = totalAmount * feeBPS[i] / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
        token.safeTransferFrom(from, feeRecipients[i], feeAmount);
        totalAmount -= feeAmount;
    }
    token.safeTransferFrom(from, feeRecipients[feeRecipients.length - 1], totalAmount);
    emit DistributeFees(feeRecipients, feeBPS, totalAmount);
}
```

## Recommendations

You need to cache the totalAmount at startup and use it to calculate the fee:

```jsx
function distributeFeesFrom(uint256 totalAmount, IERC20 token, address from) internal virtual {
+   uint256 totalAmountStart = totalAmount;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < feeRecipients.length - 1; i++) {
+       uint256 feeAmount = totalAmountStart * feeBPS[i] / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
        token.safeTransferFrom(from, feeRecipients[i], feeAmount);
        totalAmount -= feeAmount;
    }
    token.safeTransferFrom(from, feeRecipients[feeRecipients.length - 1], totalAmount);
    emit DistributeFees(feeRecipients, feeBPS, totalAmount);
}
```

`distributeFees()` is never used. Don't forget to patch this function if you decide to keep it.

# [L-01] Lack of transparency in the implementation contract prior to an upgrade

[OptionsToken.sol#L161-L163](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-token/blob/4ebc890c26b3fd6a4fae5bbdf20d4e690d2533db/src/OptionsToken.sol#L161-L163)

## Description

Usually when there is a cooldown mechanism before an upgrade, it's to give the user time to review the upgrade and decide if they want to stay or leave the project.

Here, the `initiateUpgradeCooldown()` function does not ask for the next implementation, which means that users can't review the next implementation.

## Recommendations

Create a new variable `nextImplementation`

Modify `initiateUpgradeCooldown()` like this:

```solidity
function initiateUpgradeCooldown(address _nextImplementation) external onlyOwner {
        upgradeProposalTime = block.timestamp;
				nextImplementation = _nextImplementation;
}
```

And `_authorizeUpgrade()` like this:

```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address _nextImplementation) internal override onlyOwner {
				require(nextImplementation == _nextImplementation, "Not the right implementation");
        require(upgradeProposalTime + UPGRADE_TIMELOCK < block.timestamp, "Upgrade cooldown not initiated or still ongoing");  // check the cooldown
        _clearUpgradeCooldown();
}
```

# [L-02] `getPaymentAmount()` does not return the right payment amount

[DiscountExercise.sol#L150-L152](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/options-token/blob/4ebc890c26b3fd6a4fae5bbdf20d4e690d2533db/src/exercise/DiscountExercise.sol#L150-L152)

## Description

`getPaymentAmount()` does not take the multiplier into account.

Rated as low because this can be misleading if the user/frontend relies on this function to set params.maxPaymentAmount.

## Recommendations

```jsx
function getPaymentAmount(uint256 amount) external view returns (uint256 paymentAmount) {
    paymentAmount = amount.mulWadUp(oracle.getPrice().mulDivUp(multiplier, MULTIPLIER_DENOM));
}
```

# [L-03] Lack of security checks on **constructors**

`Oracles` and `Exercise` contracts must be perfectly compatible. I recommend adding these checks to make sure there are no incompatibilities:

### In oracles contracts:

- add 18 decimal check for each tokens (`token0` and `token1`)
- make sure `token` is either `token0` or `token1`
- add a minimum time interval check for `secs` (also add this check in `setParams()`)

### In Exercise contract:

- add 18 decimal checks for each tokens (`paymentToken_` and `underlyingToken_`)
- Check that the sum of `_feeBPS` equals `FEE_DENOMINATOR` (also add this check in `setFees()`)
- add bound check for multiplier in constructor (just like like in `setMultiplier()`)

```jsx
if (
		  multiplier_ > MULTIPLIER_DENOM * 2 // over 200%
      || multiplier_ < MULTIPLIER_DENOM / 10 // under 10%
	  ) revert Exercise__MultiplierOutOfRange(); // check range
```

- check that `paymentToken_` and `underlyingToken_` are compatible with the oracle (also add this check in `setOracle()`)
