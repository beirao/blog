# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the Digit/Reliquary protocol was done by [Beirao](https://www.beirao.xyz/about), with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About Digit (Reliquary)

Digit is an improvement of the famous MasterChef contract. The goal is to distribute a reward token proportional to the amount of a user's deposit. The protocol owner can credit the contract with the reward token and set the desired issuance per second.

Compared to Masterchef, the `Reliquary` contract offers more flexibility and customization:

> _From the README_
>
> 1. Emits tokens based on the maturity of a user's investment, separated in tranches.
> 2. Binds variable emission rates to a base emission curve designed by the developer for predictable emissions.
> 3. Supports deposits and withdrawals along with these variable rates, which has historically been impossible.
> 4. Issues a 'financial NFT' to users which represents their underlying positions, able to be traded and leveraged without removing the underlying liquidity.
> 5. Can emit multiple types of rewards for each investment, as well as handle complex reward mechanisms based on deposit and withdrawal.

## Observations

### Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

I conducted a manual review of all contracts within the defined scope, with a particular focus on the `Reliquary` contract. In addition to the manual review, I executed a comprehensive fuzzing campaign using Echidna, leading to the discovery of [L-01]. I believe that these fuzzing tests enhance the confidence in the `Reliquary` contract, as they help ensure the adherence to essential invariants.

### Codebase quality analysis

The overall code quality is highly mature; however, there is a notable absence of documentation. Although the test suite is extensive, it lacks sufficient fuzzing and invariant testing. Fortunately, I addressed this issue during my engagement:https://github.com/Byte-Masons/Reliquary/pull/30

### Centralization risks

The inherent nature of the system introduces a degree of centralization. Certik had previously highlighted this centralization risk, and I have no additional comments to contribute on this matter.

### Design recommendation

I think some power users who have many relics may want to update all their relics in a single transaction. It's possible to do this using the multicall feature, but I believe it would be helpful to have a specific function that automatically updates all relics for a user.

### Mechanism review

The system has undergone four prior audits, confirming its mature architecture capable of handling non-trivial mechanisms with elegance. However, one drawback is that users must regularly invoke `updatePosition()` to optimize the yield for the next maturity. Not updating regularly will result in suboptimal yield optimization.

## Privileged Roles & Actors

**Reliquary**

- Admin roles (All set to the same multisig):
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: can add new pools
  - `OPERATOR`: can modify pools
  - `EMISSION_CURVE` : can modify the emission curve
- User:
  - open/close/manage position

# Severity classification

| Likelihood: Low    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

**Impact** - the technical, economic and reputation damage of a successful attack

**Likelihood** - the chance that a particular vulnerability gets discovered and exploited

**Severity** - the overall criticality of the risk

# Invariants implemented with Echidna

**PR with Echidna tests:** https://github.com/Byte-Masons/Reliquary/pull/30

- ✅ A user should never be able to withdraw more than deposited.
- ✅ No `position.entry` should be greater than `block.timestamp`.
- ✅ The sum of all `position.amount` should never be greater than total deposit.
- ✅ The sum of balances in levels should never be greater than total deposit.
- ✅ All arrays defining pools should be equal in size.
- ✅ The sum of all `allocPoint` must be equal to `totalAllocpoint`.
- ✅ The total reward harvested and pending should never be greater than the total emission rate.
- ❌ (L-01) `emergencyWithdraw` should burn position rewards.
- ✅ A position amount should never be greater than the `level.balance` deposited at the position level.

# Detailed Findings

# [M-01] `reaperVault` is compliant with fee on transfer tokens, but the helper is not

[DepositHelperReaperVault.sol#L94](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/Reliquary/blob/6b18d7bd19f810e6a3cb1a4550f30412fd1d8f44/contracts/helpers/DepositHelperReaperVault.sol#L94)

[ReaperVault.sol#L1089-L1092](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/reaper-core/blob/4b2af85b83f17984cf43b7d7ef51e0b25a57b339/contracts/ReaperVault.sol#L1089-L1092)

## Description

The Reaper contract is compatible with fee-on-transfer (FoT) tokens, as indicated in [ReaperVault.sol#L1089-L1092](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/reaper-core/blob/4b2af85b83f17984cf43b7d7ef51e0b25a57b339/contracts/ReaperVault.sol#L1089-L1092). However, it's important to note that the `DepositHelperReaperVault` does not share this compatibility, as highlighted in [DepositHelperReaperVault.sol#L94](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/Reliquary/blob/6b18d7bd19f810e6a3cb1a4550f30412fd1d8f44/contracts/helpers/DepositHelperReaperVault.sol#L94).

When using FoT tokens, the helper will revert during the vault deposit process because the helper's balance will be insufficient for the deposit operation ([DepositHelperReaperVault.sol#L102](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/Reliquary/blob/6b18d7bd19f810e6a3cb1a4550f30412fd1d8f44/contracts/helpers/DepositHelperReaperVault.sol#L102)).

## Recommendations

Add FoT compatibility on the helper contract:

```solidity
function _prepareDeposit(uint pid, uint amount) internal returns (uint shares) {
        IReaperVault vault = IReaperVault(reliquary.poolToken(pid));
        IERC20 token = vault.token();

        if (msg.value != 0) {
            require(amount == msg.value, "ether amount mismatch");
            require(address(token) == address(weth), "not an ether vault");
            weth.deposit{value: msg.value}();
        } else {
						uint balanceBefore = token.balanceOf(address(this));
            token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
						amount = token.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
        }
[...]
```

# [L-01] `emergencyWithdraw` may not burn rewards and redistribute them unfairly

[Reliquary.sol#L312-L328](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/Reliquary/blob/6b18d7bd19f810e6a3cb1a4550f30412fd1d8f44/contracts/Reliquary.sol#L312-L328)

## Description

If the underlying pool of a position emergency withdrawn is not updated, pending rewards from this position will be redistributed and not burned.

This is not critical but there is an inconsistency in the treatment of reward burns.

_Call sequence that break the invariant:_

![Untitled](/static/images/blog-img/SR3-3.png)

## Recommendations

Before subtracting the amount, add `_updatePool(poolId);` to update the pool and account rewards.

```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(uint relicId) external override nonReentrant {
    address to = ownerOf(relicId);
    if (to != msg.sender) revert NotOwner();

    PositionInfo storage position = positionForId[relicId];
    uint amount = position.amount;
    uint poolId = position.poolId;

    // @audit L-01 correction
    _updatePool(poolId); //!

    levels[poolId].balance[position.level] -= amount;

    _burn(relicId);
    delete positionForId[relicId];

    IERC20(poolToken[poolId]).safeTransfer(to, amount);

    emit ReliquaryEvents.EmergencyWithdraw(poolId, amount, to, relicId);
}
```

# [L-02] Pools are not updated before setting a new curve

[Reliquary.sol#L111-L114](https://github.com/Byte-Masons/Reliquary/blob/6b18d7bd19f810e6a3cb1a4550f30412fd1d8f44/contracts/Reliquary.sol#L111-L114)

## Description

Pools are not updated before a new curve is set, so users may be over or under rewarded depending on the new curve rate and the last pool update.

## Recommendations

Update all pools before setting a new emission curve.

```solidity
function setEmissionCurve(address _emissionCurve) external override onlyRole(EMISSION_CURVE) {
    for (uint i; i < poolLength(); ) {
        _updatePool(i);
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
    emissionCurve = _emissionCurve;
    emit ReliquaryEvents.LogSetEmissionCurve(_emissionCurve);
}
```
