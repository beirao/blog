# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the Granary V2 protocol was done by [Beirao](https://www.beirao.xyz/about), with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About Cod3x Lend

The purpose of this audit is to highlight high level errors due to the new rehypothecation and minipool mechanism. This is not a line-by-line review, so some hidden errors may remain.

## Observations

Cod3x lend is a AAVE V2 fork that adds:

- Updated pragmas (^0.8.0)
- Lending pool external rehypothecation
- The concept of minipools. Minipools are sub-markets that have a privileged borrowing capacity on the main lending pool.

## Privileged Roles & Actors

Same as AAVE V2 [roles](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/the-core-protocol/addresses-provider/ilendingpooladdressesprovider#ilendingpooladdressesprovider.sol).

# Detailed Findings

# [C-01] Main lendingPool liquidations breaks internal accounting due to rehypothecation.

https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/blob/0f8a29b3daead4e73f09c2c827a6f237f664c2cf/contracts/protocol/core/minipool/MiniPoolCollateralManager.sol#L225-L227

https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/blob/0f8a29b3daead4e73f09c2c827a6f237f664c2cf/contracts/protocol/core/lendingpool/LendingPoolCollateralManager.sol#L213-L215

## Severity

**Impact:** High, breaks liquidity accounting.

**Likelihood:** High, happens on every liquidations.

## Description

When the `aToken` is repaid, `handleRepayment()` must be called to update the aToken's internal accounting. This function is not called on `lendingpool` and `minipool` liquidations. This will confuse the accounting of the `aToken` and `AERC6909`.

## Recommendations

`handleRepayment()` must be added on liquidation logic. on [lendingpool](https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/blob/0f8a29b3daead4e73f09c2c827a6f237f664c2cf/contracts/protocol/core/lendingpool/LendingPoolCollateralManager.sol#L216) and [minipool](https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/blob/0f8a29b3daead4e73f09c2c827a6f237f664c2cf/contracts/protocol/core/minipool/MiniPoolCollateralManager.sol#L228).

# [H-01] `protocol/configuration` is not mature enough ⇒ `Minipool` and `aERC6909` can’t be updgraded

https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/tree/main/contracts/protocol/configuration

## Severity

**Impact:** High, if a vulnerability is found in the minipool or AERC6909 implementations, the administrator will not be able to update + the admin address cannot be changed.

**Likelihood:** Medium, it can happen.

## Description

- Lack of setter to change the admin in `MiniPoolAddressesProvider`.
- `LendingPoolAddressesProviderRegistry` can be removed since the main lendingpool should only be deployed once on a chain.
- add a `setAddressAsProxy` in `MiniPoolAddressesProvider` just like in `LendingPoolAddressesProvider`.
- `setMiniPoolImpl` and `setAToken6909Impl` should call `_updateImpl` instead of just updating the storage.
- add a `getMinipoolsList` getter.
- more generally cleanup everything and normalize typos between `LendingPoolAddressesProvider` and `MiniPoolAddressesProvider`.
- maybe remove the `_marketId` variable from `LendingPoolAddressesProvider`.
- cleanup the `MiniPoolAddressesProvider` storage.

# [L-01] `deposit()` should check if the minipool has debts and repay it if necessary

https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/blob/0f8a29b3daead4e73f09c2c827a6f237f664c2cf/contracts/protocol/core/minipool/MiniPool.sol#L126

## Description

If a minipool has flow borrowed from the main lendingpool, the deposited funds will not repay the debt, but will simply be transfered to the aToken as usual.

Minipool debt from the main lendingpool should always be the first debt to be repaid.

## Recommendations

Add `_repayLendingPool()` in `Lendingpool.deposit()`.

# [L-02] Remove `recentBorrow` logic since it’s not fully implemented and dangerous

https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/blob/main/contracts/protocol/libraries/configuration/UserRecentBorrow.sol

## Description

The goal of the `recentBorrow` logic was to adjust the LTV and liquidation threshold depending on the collateral used. This logic was not fully implemented.

## Recommendations

Regarding Zigtur issue M-04, I recommend removing `recentBorrow` from `BorrowLogic` and `FlashLoanLogic` on both `lendingpool` and `minipool`.

# [L-03] `AERC6909.getIdForUnderlying()` is error prone

https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/blob/0f8a29b3daead4e73f09c2c827a6f237f664c2cf/contracts/protocol/tokenization/ERC6909/ATokenERC6909.sol#L297-L308

## Description

`getIdForUnderlying()` doesn't have the same effect depending on whether the `asset` is `tranched` or not. If the asset is an aToken, the output is deterministic. If the asset is a classic ERC20, then the return IDs are the next correct IDs.

## Recommendations

Create 2 different functions: one deterministic and one non-deterministic.

# [L-04] `_repayLendingPool()` can be safer and simplified

https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/blob/0f8a29b3daead4e73f09c2c827a6f237f664c2cf/contracts/protocol/core/minipool/logic/MiniPoolBorrowLogic.sol#L321-L325

https://github.com/Cod3x-Labs/Cod3x-Lend/blob/0f8a29b3daead4e73f09c2c827a6f237f664c2cf/contracts/protocol/core/minipool/MiniPool.sol#L268

## Description

Sometimes the amount passed to `_repayLendingPool` is different from the actual amount repaid.

We can be improve `minipool._repayLendingpool()` by just removing the amount passed and always repay the maximum possible debt. (see recommendations)

## Recommendations

# [I-01] Move `MiniPoolCollateralManager` in the liquidation logic lib
